# COMP0055: Seeing is Not Believing
Team segfault

Implementation of the camouflage attack described by Xiao et. al. in their paper, Seeing is Not Believing (2019).

This implementation generates attack images as described in the paper using DCCP and CVXPY in Python in Google Colab. Generated attack images are in the attack_images folder.

Currently, the attack images and the dimensions of the output image (dimensions to be resized to) are:

Attack Image | Output dimensions

atk_jeff.jpg | (250, 203)

atk_sheep.jpg | (229, 229)

atk_ronnie.jpg | (172, 229)

atk_cat.jpg | (124, 229)
